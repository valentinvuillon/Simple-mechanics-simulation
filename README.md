This is a simulation of a square of mass $m$, which is on a surface with a friction coefficient $\alpha$. The user can apply a constant external force on the square. And the square is bouncing on the walls. The walls have a coefficient $\beta$. The velocity after a collision with a wall  $v_{out}$ is given by $v_{out}=\beta \cdot v_{in}$ with $v_{in}$ the velocity of the square before the collision.


The integration method to obtain the velocity and position is the forward Euler method. The method is called four times between each frames.
